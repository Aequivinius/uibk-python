## A text about me

As requested in `exercise-1`, I will now add a little text about myself (with some delay) to practice markdown and working with git. I hope that whoever reads this might join, so I am not the only one to introduce myself. :)  
(Note that you have to add .md at the end of your filename to get a markdown file.)

## Who am I?

That question is far to philosophical to be answered here, I guess, but to answer it the ordinary way: I am a linguistics student who is (obviously) interested in languages, but also music, dancing, (vegetarian) food, books, nature, yoga...

## What is my programming experience?
I only entered the _world of programming_ last semester, when I took a introductory [python course](https://lfuonline.uibk.ac.at/public/lfuonline_lv.details?sem_id_in=21S&lvnr_id_in=198801). This is the first module in the minor _Digital Science_ taught by [DiSC](https://www.uibk.ac.at/disc/teaching/index.html.de). Even though it was quite overwhelming at the beginning, I really enjoyed it. In this course we learned about basic concepts, like datatypes (str/float/int/bool), lists, dictionaries, loops, conditions, functions and also doctests to test our functions. We also learned about style related issues to write "prettier" code.
So I do know quite a bit about basic concepts, but since that course was a general introduction, I do not konw much about packages and usage related to linguistic tasks - which is why I signed up for this Python for Linguists course. :)

PS: If you are reading this and are somewhat curious about programming, I highly recommend watching [this stunning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQXXMycJwlM) about the art of code. It's mesmerizing. You won't regret it! :)

I wish you all the best!
