# This is the skeleton for exercise-2. The goal is to change the fizzbuzz()
# function so that it returns the string "fizz", if the number passed as an
# argument is divisible by 3, "buzz" if it is divisible by 5, and "fizzbuzz"
# if it is divisible by 3 and 5. You can use the predefined
# computer_remainder() function.


def compute_remainder(number, divisor):
    return number % divisor


def fizzbuzz(number):
    if compute_remainder(number, 3) == 0 and compute_remainder(number, 5) == 0:
        fizzbuzz_number = 'fizzbuzz'
    elif compute_remainder(number, 3) == 0:
        fizzbuzz_number = 'fizz'
    elif compute_remainder(number, 5) == 0:
        fizzbuzz_number = 'buzz'
    else:
        fizzbuzz_number = number
    return fizzbuzz_number


# this part below prints the result of the fizzbuzz function for the first 45
# numbers
for number in range(0, 46):
    print(str(number) + " : " + str(fizzbuzz(number)))
